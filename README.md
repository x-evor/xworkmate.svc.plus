# XWorkmate

XWorkmate is a Flutter-based AI workspace shell for running assistant threads, local or remote gateway tasks, and multi-agent collaboration in one app.

## Project

XWorkmate combines a desktop-first Flutter app, persistent assistant task threads, and optional multi-agent orchestration.
It is designed for users who want a single workspace for AI chat, gateway-backed execution, and packaged local tooling across macOS, web, and other client surfaces.

## TL;DR

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run -d macos
```

## Xcode Run For macOS

XWorkmate only supports launching the macOS app from the workspace entrypoint:

```bash
open macos/Runner.xcworkspace
```

If you prefer a repo-native shortcut, run:

```bash
make open-macos-xcode
```

In Xcode:

- Select the shared `Runner` scheme.
- Select `My Mac` as the destination.
- Configure signing only on the `Runner` target.
- Leave CocoaPods plugin targets under `Pods` alone. They appear in the workspace by design and are not app signing targets.

For release builds, archives, and packaging, continue to use:

```bash
flutter build macos
make build-macos
```
